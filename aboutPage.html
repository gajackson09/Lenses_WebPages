            <span class="paragraph">Lenses is a website for photographers and anyone who wants to post photos. We believe that during this time, photos are being overlooked because of the rise in popularity of short form video content. We want to be the place where photographers can post their photos while also people with no photography experience can post and like other user’s posts. We want to be the website you think of when you are thinking of photo sharing.<br /></span>
            
            <span class="paraHeader"><br />Our Vision<br /></span>
            
            <span class="paragraph">We value the progression of photography. Photography has been around for a long time and during this age where everything has a camera, the art of photography cannot go into decline. At Lenses, we will provide a platform where users can upload high quality photos and also get professional help from professional photographers. We want our website to grow a community of not only photographers, but people who appreciate the art of photography.<br /><br /></span>
            
            <span class="paraHeader">Our Values<br /></span>
            
            <span class="paragraph">We want to be an app that has a strong community of people who appreciate photography. We want to provide our users with the help they need in any aspect of photography. We also want to provide a platform where anyone can upload high quality photos. We want to be THE photo sharing app in a time where every other social media app is moving towards video.</span>
